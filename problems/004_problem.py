Problem 4 - Largest palindrome product
======================================

A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from
the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

from utils.number import is_palindrome

    for y in range(100, 1000):

            product = max(product, x * y)

print(product)

# Answer: 906609
